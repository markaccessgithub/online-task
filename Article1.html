            <h1>Local Town Elects Sentient Refrigerator as Mayor</h1>
            <p>Residents of Pickleshire, a small town in Ohio, have made history by electing a sentient refrigerator, “Frosty 3000,” as their new mayor in a landslide vote:

                Frosty, a state-of-the-art smart fridge powered by an experimental AI, first gained popularity after offering free snack recommendations during local council meetings: The fridge’s slogan, “Fresh Ideas for a Fresh Future,” resonated with citizens, especially after its main opponent, incumbent mayor Henry McDull, ran on a platform of “lukewarm leadership:”

                Critics argue Frosty’s constant need for Wi-Fi connectivity could lead to cybersecurity risks, but its supporters remain unfazed: “What’s more important—freedom or perfectly chilled water?” asked resident and amateur philosopher, Clive Jar:</p>
