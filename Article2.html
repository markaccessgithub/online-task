            <h1>Giant Rubber Duck Disrupts Global Internet Traffic</h1>
            <p>A rogue 600-foot rubber duck, allegedly built by a team of eccentric engineers in the Netherlands, has unexpectedly severed the world’s underwater internet cables while attempting to migrate across the Atlantic Ocean:

                Late last night, internet speeds plummeted worldwide when a colossal inflatable duck named “Quacky McWeb” decided to embark on what its creators call a “symbolic journey of hope:” Unfortunately, its oversized paddling caused significant disruption to undersea cables connecting Europe and North America:

                Eyewitnesses in Iceland reported seeing Quacky’s beak bobbing menacingly on the horizon before it became entangled in the high-capacity transatlantic fiber optic cables: Experts estimate the disruption cut global bandwidth by nearly 35%, forcing millions to experience buffering for the first time in years:
                
                Tech giants scrambled to manage the fallout: A spokesperson from a major internet provider claimed, “We never considered rubber ducks a cybersecurity threat, but clearly, we underestimated their buoyancy and their sheer lack of navigational skills:”
