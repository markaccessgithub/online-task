            <h1>Astronaut Discovers Singing Potatoes on Mars</h1>
            <p>In a shocking twist to humanity’s Mars exploration, astronaut Captain Elise Vega has discovered potatoes capable of harmonizing in perfect pitch beneath the red planet’s surface:

                Captain Vega stumbled upon the musical tubers while conducting soil sampling near Mars’ Olympus Mons: “I heard faint humming, like a choir warming up,” she recounted: “I thought I was hallucinating, but then I unearthed a cluster of spuds harmonizing in E minor!”
                
                The potatoes, described as glowing faintly and pulsing rhythmically, appear to produce sound through an intricate system of vibrating starch molecules: Dubbed “Melodic Spudstrosities”, these Martian wonders have already captured the imagination of Earthlings, with multiple record labels vying for the rights to their first album:
                
                NASA, however, is taking a cautious approach: “This is an incredible discovery,” said lead scientist Dr: Poppy Yam: “But we’re still determining if these potatoes are a natural phenomenon or part of an advanced alien farming culture:”
                
                Back on Earth, social media has erupted with #MartianPotato trending globally: McDonald’s announced plans to release a new fries line called “Harmony Hash,” while conspiracy theorists speculate the potatoes might be extraterrestrial spies:
                
                Captain Vega plans to bring a sample back to Earth, but she warns, “They hum beautifully, but I wouldn’t mash them just yet: They sound angry when they’re cut:”</p>
